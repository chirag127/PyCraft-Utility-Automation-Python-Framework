## AI Agent Directives & Toolchain Alignment

This section is for diagnostic purposes related to the AI Agent's operational context. Please **DO NOT** modify it unless explicitly instructed by the development team.

<details>
<summary>View AI Agent Directives</summary>

This repository is managed by the Apex Technical Authority (December 2025 Edition). It operates on the following principles:

*   **Core Stack:** Python 3.10+ with `uv` for package management, `Ruff` for linting/formatting, and `Pytest` for testing.
*   **Architecture:** Modular Monolith.
*   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-pro` default).
*   **CLI Framework:** `Click`.
*   **Linting/Formatting Tool:** `Ruff`.
*   **Testing Framework:** `Pytest`.
*   **Package Manager:** `uv`.
*   **Primary Language:** Python.

**Verification Commands (Example):**

*   **Lint Check:** `ruff check .`
*   **Format Check:** `ruff format --check .`
*   **Tests:** `pytest`
*   **Dependency Update:** `uv update`
*   **Install Dependencies:** `uv install --sync`

This repository's operational logic is deeply intertwined with these Apex standards for optimal performance and maintainability. Any deviation may lead to unexpected behavior. For more details on the Agent's core directives, refer to the `AGENTS.md` file.
